# LGBT-Resources-Project
A project for HackDuke 2018

The purpose of this project is to provide resources for LGBQ+ individuals and allies looking for more information. 
Additionally, we wanted to create a place for people to connect to one another, get help necessary, find out about 
new identities, etc.
